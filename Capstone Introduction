When choosing business location, we should take into consideration lots of factors that are not easy to evaluate. Some of
these factors are number of competitors and the number of clients that you will be exposed to (we will call this crowdedness).
In order to evaluate each of these factors we need a detailed analysis for every location we might consider. The goal 
of this project is to facilitate the decision making based on the number of competitors and crowdedness in the chosen city.
The methodology and results of the project can be used by an organization who is willing to relocate its business or create 
a new franchise.
