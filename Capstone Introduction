One of the most important decisions an entrepreneur needs to take is to choose or to move his business location. 
What motivates business relocation is always money. Entrepreneur is avoiding money loss or perceiving new opportunities 
of money gain [1]. When choosing a business location, many factors should be considered and well studied. 
In this project we will consider two of them. The first one is foot traffic. Depending on business nature, entrepreneur 
may need more or less pedestrian traffic. Besides, depending on business, nearby competitors may be beneficial or not for 
a business [2].
The goal of this project is to provide an analysis and visualizations to help entrepreneur who is willing to choose 
his business location to better understand foot traffic and competitiveness in every neighborhood in a city of his choice.
This analysis will be applied on the city of Toronto, CA and as an illustrative example we will suppose that business is 
about a restaurant. But the same analysis could be applied to any other city and with any other business.
