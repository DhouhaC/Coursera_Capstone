In this project we will give an example of how one can analyse competitiveness and crowdedness in a city chosen to be the next
destination of a new business. The chosen city is Toronto and the business is a home store. The goal of this analysis is to 
give labeled map that compares neighborhoods visually to facilitate the decision making.
We will use Toronto data (neighborhoods and geospatial data) as well as Foursquare data to calculate competitiveness 
and crowdedness for every neighborhood and then visualize differences between neighborhoods using a labeled map.
To calculate competitiveness, we need to calculate number of venues that have the Venue Category (home store) for every neighborhood.
Since we can't get exact value of crowdedness, we will get estimated value using available data. We will calculate for every 
neighborhood the distance to the nearest neighborhood, using Longitude and Latitude of neighborhoods. Then, we will divide the 
number of venues in this neighborhood by this distance. Finally, we will normalize data to get values between 0 and 1.
