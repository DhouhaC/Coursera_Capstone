Two main sources of data will be used in this project. The first one is a Wikipedia web page [3]. 
We will scrape this page to get a complete list of Toronto neighborhood as well as corresponding postal codes. 
The second source of our data is Foursquare API [4]. The API will provide us information about venues in Toronto like 
Venue name, address, category and geospatial information. This data will be used to first calculate the total number 
of venues for every neighborhood. Then, we will use it to calculate for a given address the number of competitors based 
within a chosen radius. Besides, the category data about venues is useful to filter competitors of a given business and 
to make neighborhood clustering. Another csv file that contains correspondence between postal code, latitude and longitude 
will be mainly used to get geospatial data for every neighborhood.
